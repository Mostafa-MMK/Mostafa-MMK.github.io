My research investigates the intricate connections between financial markets, risk propagation, and macroeconomic stability. I employ a multidisciplinary approach that integrates quantitative analysis, complex systems modeling, and advanced statistical techniques to dissect the mechanisms driving financial crises and asset price dynamics. My work is situated at the intersection of risk management, asset pricing, and data-driven financial analysis, with the overarching goal of developing more robust frameworks for understanding and mitigating systemic risk.

### Core Research Areas:

*   **Systemic Risk and Financial Crises:** Analyzing the propagation of shocks and contagion effects within interconnected financial systems.
*   **Asset Pricing Dynamics:** Investigating the determinants of asset valuations and market reactions to new information.
*   **Quantitative and Computational Finance:** Developing and backtesting novel risk models and analytical tools using advanced computational methods.

### **Empirical Testing of Value-at-Risk (VaR) Methodologies**

Value-at-Risk (VaR) is a cornerstone of market risk management, providing a statistical estimate of potential portfolio losses. [5] However, the reliability of VaR is contingent on the chosen calculation method and its underlying assumptions. My Master's thesis at Goethe University, titled "[Empirical Testing of Value-at-Risk (VaR) Models](https://github.com/Mostafa-MMK/MMF_Thesis)," conducted a comprehensive empirical investigation into the performance of twelve distinct VaR approaches.

This research utilized extensive datasets spanning major financial markets—including equities, fixed income, commodities, and foreign exchange—to rigorously backtest each model. The analysis systematically identified the strengths and weaknesses of various methods, such as historical simulation, variance-covariance, and Monte Carlo simulation, under different market conditions. The findings revealed critical limitations in conventional models and highlighted specific scenarios where certain approaches fail to capture tail risk, offering valuable insights for enhancing the robustness of financial risk modeling. The complete thesis, including the datasets and Python-based analytical notebooks, is available upon request.

### **Financial Contagion & Risk Spillover: A Complex Network Approach**

Financial systems can be conceptualized as complex networks where institutions are interconnected through a web of obligations. Shocks originating in one part of this network can propagate and amplify, leading to systemic crises—a phenomenon known as financial contagion. During my Research Master's program at Northwestern Polytechnical University, I collaborated on a project that employed complex network theory and graph-based models to investigate risk spillover across global financial markets.

This research examined the topological properties of financial networks and their role in transmitting risk across different asset classes, markets, and geographical regions, with a particular focus on the global financial crisis. By modeling the interconnectedness of financial entities, our work provides a framework for understanding how localized shocks can escalate into widespread systemic events. Several papers from this ongoing research are currently under review or in preparation for submission to peer-reviewed journals.

### **Central Bank Communication and High-Frequency Market Reactions**

Central bank communications are a critical tool for guiding market expectations and influencing asset prices. The tone and sentiment of these announcements can convey subtle but powerful signals to market participants. In a project initiated during my studies at Goethe University, I explored the intersection of computational linguistics and finance by analyzing the sentiment of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes.

This research utilized text analytics and sentiment analysis to quantify the tone of central bank communications and examined the subsequent reactions in the U.S. stock market at a high-frequency trading (HFT) level. The study investigates the immediacy and decay of market responses to shifts in monetary policy sentiment, assessing how this information is incorporated into asset prices. A working paper from this project, "FOMC Tone Sentiment and US Stock Market Reactions," is currently being prepared for submission to a scholarly journal.

My research focuses on understanding the ocean's role in the climate system, particularly the intricate dynamics of energy transfer and air-sea interaction. I use a combination of climate model analysis, novel statistical techniques, and open-source software development to investigate these processes across different scales. Broadly, my research **interests** are:

- Risk and finanical crisis
- Asset pricing
- Quantitative analysis










## Empirical Testing of VaR Methods

Value at Risk (VaR) is a popular risk managment tools across the financial markets and practioners - especially the market risk modeling and mangement. In my master thesis (MSc in Money and Finance at Goethe University), I investigated 12 different approaches to calculate VaR conducting the analysis across the different financial markets - Stocks, bonds, commodities, and FX into in a huge amount of datasets. The robust backtestings assured the models loopwholes and unerathed some critical aspects for risk modeling. The findings are compiled into the Master Thesis - full details are available (with datasets and Python notebooks) upon request.


## Financial Contagion & Risk Spillover (Complex Network Approach)

With colleagues during my Reserach Master Program at [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/), I investigated the complex network approaches and risk spillover across the global finanical markets using graph theory models. We have worked collaboratively throughout the projects, and investigated the different asset classes, markets, and regions at the presence of the global financial crisis. Some of the papers are still work in progress and/or in process of publications (please see the following Work-in-Progress and Publication sections for the lists).

## Central Bank Communication and Market Reactions 

During my M.Sc. in Money and Finance at [Goethe University](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/de?locale=de), I investigated several domains of text analytics, specially, tone sentiment of the central bank communications and what messages they do signal to the financial markets. In the project, I conducted research to see the FOMC meeting minutes tone sentiments and stock market reactions in the HFT levels and how the sentiment errodes as time passages and fair value of the assets. The paper is still work-in progress and will be submitting for publication soon.
