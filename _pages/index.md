# About Me

Hi 👋, I'm Md Mostafa Kamal, a researcher and practitioner specializing in quantitative analysis and risk management 🚦. My work bridges the crucial gap between theory and practice.

My expertise spans quantitative risk management, derivatives pricing and volatility modeling 📈, algorithmic and FX trading strategies 🤖, fixed income and yield curve analysis 📊, and the dynamics of financial contagion and spillover risk 🌐. Through this platform, I am excited to share my [academic research](https://mostafa-mmk.github.io/research/) 📄, [projects](https://mostafa-mmk.github.io/projects/), and professional [resources](https://mostafa-mmk.github.io/resources/) to support and collaborate with fellow finance professionals, academics, and enthusiasts.
